-----------------------------

Summary:
An object-relational-mapping from Java objects to MongoDB using annotations.
The ORM can save individual objects and collections of objects to a database 
    and retrieve them.
Only serializes and deserializes fields that are:
    - prefixed with @MongoField
    - Strings
    - primitive types    
Only allows collections whose values or keys are mongo collections.

Limitations:
Works with Collections but does not work with Maps.

Usage: 
java TestORM
to run the provided test file (an Employee-Manager database) while MongoDB is running
